// ================================================= What is Object-Oriented Programming =============================================
/*
  OOP
  - Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects.
  - We use objects to model (describe) real-world or abstract features.
  - Objects may contain data (properties) and code (methods). By using objects, we pack data
    and the corresponding behavior into one block.
  - In OOP, objects are self-contained pieces/blocks of code.
  - Objects are building blocks of applications, and interact with one another.
  - Interactions happens through a public interface (API): methodes that the code outside of the object
    can access and use to communicate with the object.
  - OOP was developed with the goal of organizing code, to make it more flexible and easier to maintain (avoid "spaghetti code").
